## Minimum requirements

Android SDK version 21 is the minimum version required for using the Sinch Verification SDK.

## ProGuard

There is no need to add any specific *ProGuard* rules connected with Verification library as each module contains specific `consumer-rules.pro` file that will be automatically consumed by the the client application.

## Encryption export regulations

Please check the Summary of U.S. Export Controls Applicable to Commercial Encryption Products and ensure that the application is registered for the Encryption Regulations, if applicable. It can be found under this [link](http://www.sinch.com/).
